<!-- // ## **Part Two - Movies App!**
// Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

// - Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
// - When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
// - When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.

// ## **Further Study**

// - Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.
// - Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.
// - Allow users to sort alphabetically by the title of the movie or by the rating of the movie from lowest to highest and vice versa. -->
