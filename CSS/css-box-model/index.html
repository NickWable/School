    <h3>
        What is the box model?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Everything on a webpage has a box around it wether it's visible or not. The body, headders, links, buttons, everything.

    <h3>
        What is the difference between margin and padding?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Margin is the "outter" space you can use to manipulate the placement of elements. While padding is the "inner" space used to manipulate the content inside an element.
        </p>

    <h3>
        What is collapsing margin?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Margins by default will vertically collapse on eachother but not horizontally. If you have a margin of 10px then place a margin of 20px below the first margin the total margin will be 20px.
        </p>

    <h3>
        What is the purpose of the box-sizing CSS property?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Box sizing defines how the overall width and height of an element is calculated. There is the default "content-box" and the "border-box" which is easier to use.
        </p>

    <h3>
        What does the outline property do?
    </h3>
        <p>
            The outline is like a border, it is a line that goes around the outside of the content and even borders. It also doesnt displace any other content on the page.
        </p>

    <h3>
        How do you add a background image in CSS?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Using the "background-image" tag you can add urls, colors, gradients. You can also add multiple "background-image" tags to a single element.
        </p>

    <h3>
        Given a div with a width of 200px, margin of 20px and padding of 20px, what is the calculated width by the browser?
    </h3>
        <p>
            The margin and padding on both left and right sides will equal 40px, the div is 200px so the calculated width would be 240px. 
        </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>
        Given a div with a height of 100px, border of 10px and padding of 20px, what is the calculated height by the browser?
    </h3>
        <p>
            The total height is 100px, so the div would be 70px to allow space for the border and padding. 
        </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>
        What does margin:auto do?
    </h3>
        <p>
            Margin:auto will center content within the body depending on the display property and position property.
