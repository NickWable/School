JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
looks similar to JS objects but all the keys must be "double-quoted"
{
    "person": {
        "name": "Mike",
        "favoriteDino": "Megalodon",
        "server": "2129",
        "KDR": 69,
        "Allies": ["Good Comms", "No Limit", "Chem B", "FTG", "Lava Chair", "LOTD", "Carebears"]
        "Dreams": null
    }
}
