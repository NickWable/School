AJAX means asynchronous javascript and xml (used to be mostly XML but now we use JSON)
Can load content from and api and get data back without refreshing the page. 

Example: AJAX web request
    Made from JS in browser
    JS makes request(GET,POST, etc)
    You recieve response
    Do whatever with the result

AJAX is not a specific technology  or library, its a way of structuring webpages and making requests
